Novak Djokovic[a] (Serbian: Новак Ђоковић / Novak Đoković, pronounced [nôvaːk dʑôːkovitɕ] ⓘ;[7] born 22 May 1987) is a Serbian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for a record 428 weeks across a record 13 different years, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times.[8] Djokovic has won 100 singles titles, including a record 72 Big Titles: a record 24 majors, a record 40 Masters, a record seven year-end championships, and an Olympic gold medal. Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to complete a Career Golden Masters, a feat he has accomplished twice. Djokovic is the only player in singles to have won all of the Big Titles over the course of his career.

Djokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic was referred to as the "Big Three" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade.[9] Djokovic had his most successful season in 2015, reaching a record 15 consecutive finals and winning a record 10 Big Titles while earning a record 31 victories over top 10 players.[10] His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously and setting a rankings points record of 16,950.

In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened his results until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where he won the title while ranked No. 21 in the world. Djokovic then returned to a dominant status, winning 12 major titles and completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. Due to his opposition to the COVID-19 vaccine, he was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[11] notably the Australian Open and the US Open, being deported from the country in the former case.[12][13] One year after the Australian visa controversy, he made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[14] and shortly after claimed the all-time record for most men's singles majors titles.[15] In 2024, he became the only player to complete a career sweep of the Big Titles.

Representing Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. In singles, he won the gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics and the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He is a recipient of the Order of Karađorđe Star, Order of St. Sava, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. He has been named the BTA Best Balkan Athlete of the Year a record eight times.[16]

Beyond competition, Djokovic was elected as the president of the ATP Player Council in 2016. He stepped down in 2020 to front a new player-only tennis association; the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) founded by him and Vasek Pospisil, citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players.[17][18] Djokovic is an active philanthropist. He is the founder of Novak Djokovic Foundation, which is committed to supporting children from disadvantaged communities.[19] Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015.[20]

Early and personal life
Novak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic. He is of paternal Serbian and maternal Croatian descent.[21] His two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, have also played professional tennis.[22]

Djokovic began playing tennis at the age of four,[22] after his parents gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, which his father said became "the most beloved toy in his life".[23] His parents then sent him to a tennis camp in Novi Sad.[23][24] In the summer of 1993, as a six-year-old, he was sent to a tennis camp organized by the Teniski Klub Partizan and overseen by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić[24][25] at Mount Kopaonik, where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour.[23][26][27] Genčić worked with Djokovic over the following six years, convincing him to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the single hand used by his idol, Pete Sampras.[2][28][29] Djokovic has credited Genčić for "shaping my mind as a human being, but also as a professional".[30][31]

During the Yugoslav Wars in the late 1990s, Serbia had to endure embargoes[31] and NATO bombings[22][26][28] because of the Kosovo War.[22][32] At one point Djokovic had to train inside a disused swimming pool converted into a tennis court.[33] Due to his rapid development, Genčić contacted Nikola Pilić and in September 1999 Djokovic moved to the Pilić tennis academy in Oberschleißheim, Germany, spending four years there.[2][26][34] Pilić made him serve against a wall for several months to improve his technique, and he had him working with a rubber exercise band for a year to improve flexibility in his wrist.[26] One of the players he trained with at the Niki Pilić academy was future world No. 10 Ernests Gulbis, with whom he allegedly had a fiery rivalry.[35][36]

His father also took him to train at academies in the United States, Italy, and Germany.[23] Because of the high cost of traveling and training his father took out high-interest loans to help pay for his son's tennis education, putting Djokovic under immense pressure to deliver.[23][26][28] He believes the impact this had on him could be the reason behind his prowess under pressure.[24][26]

He met his future wife, Jelena Ristić, in high school, and began dating her in 2005.[37] The two became engaged in September 2013,[38] and on 10 July 2014 the couple were married on Montenegro's Sveti Stefan island, in the Church of Saint Stephen (Serbian: Црква Светог Архиђакона Стефана).[39][40][41] He and Ristić had their first child, a boy, in October 2014.[42][43] Their daughter was born in 2017.[44]

Djokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish to varying levels of proficiency.[45][46][47][48]

As top seed at the Australian Open, he defeated Rafael Nadal in the final to claim his record seventh Australian Open and 15th major title.[194] He was then upset by Philipp Kohlschreiber at the Indian Wells Masters third round,[195] and lost in the fourth round of the Miami Open to Bautista Agut.[196] On clay, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to Daniil Medvedev.[197] During the Madrid Open, he celebrated his 250th week at world number 1 in the ATP rankings[198] and won the title by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas.[199] At the Italian Open, he reached the final after beating Juan Martín del Potro,[200] but lost to Nadal.[201] At the French Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals without dropping a set, becoming the first man to reach 10 consecutive French Open quarterfinals. He lost a marathon five-set match to Dominic Thiem, ending a 26-match winning streak in majors and his bid for a second 'Nole Slam'.[202] Djokovic defended his title at Wimbledon, beating Roger Federer in a record 4-hour 57-minute five-set final. Despite winning fewer points, Djokovic saved two championship points to claim his fifth Wimbledon and 16th major title.[203][204] He lost in the semifinals of the Cincinnati Open to eventual champion Medvedev,[205] and retired injured in the fourth round of the US Open against Stan Wawrinka.[206] In October, Djokovic won the Japan Open over John Millman[207] but lost in the quarterfinals of the Shanghai Masters to Tsitsipas.[208] He ended the season by winning his fifth Paris Masters title against Denis Shapovalov.[209]

Main article: 2020 Novak Djokovic tennis season
At the inaugural 2020 ATP Cup, Djokovic led Serbia to victory with six wins, including over Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals and Rafael Nadal in the final.[210] At the Australian Open, he beat Roger Federer in the semifinals and defeated Dominic Thiem in five sets in the final, earning his eighth Australian Open and 17th Grand Slam title.[211] He regained the world No. 1 ranking[212] and became the first player in the Open Era to win Grand Slams in three different decades. It was also his first comeback win from two sets to one down in a major final.[213] Djokovic then claimed his fifth title at the Dubai Championships, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[214][215] In June, during the Adria Tour he organized, Djokovic tested positive for COVID-19, along with several other participants, prompting criticism over the event's lack of safety protocols.[216][217][218] Djokovic later apologized, saying they believed the tournament met all health guidelines, but acknowledged they "were wrong".[219] He later described the criticism as part of a "witch hunt".[220]

2021: Major titles on all three surfaces
Main article: 2021 Novak Djokovic tennis season
Djokovic began the year at the 2021 ATP Cup, winning both singles matches, but Serbia exited in the group stage.[221] He then won his ninth Australian Open title and 18th major overall, defeating Daniil Medvedev in the final.[222] On 1 March, Djokovic tied and then surpassed Roger Federer's Open Era record of 310 weeks as world No. 1.[223][224] He suffered early losses at the Monte-Carlo Masters (to Dan Evans)[225] and Serbia Open (to Aslan Karatsev),[226] and reached the final of the Italian Open, defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas and Lorenzo Sonego, before losing to Rafael Nadal.

At the French Open, he beat Nadal in a four-set semifinal and came from two sets down to defeat Tsitsipas in the final.[227] He became the first man in the Open Era to win a major after coming from two sets down twice in the same event,[228] and the first to win all four majors at least twice in the Open Era.[229][230][231] At Wimbledon, he earned his 100th grass-court win en route to the final,[232] where he defeated Matteo Berrettini to win his sixth title and 20th major, tying Federer and Nadal. He became the second man to win majors on all three surfaces in a single year (a "Surface Slam"),[233] and the fifth in the Open Era to achieve the Channel Slam (French Open and Wimbledon in the same year).[234] At the 2020 Summer Olympics, Djokovic sought a gold medal, but lost to Alexander Zverev in the semifinals and to Pablo Carreño Busta in the bronze match.[235] In mixed doubles, partnering Nina Stojanović, they reached the semifinals but withdrew from the bronze medal match due to Djokovic's shoulder injury.[236]

Australian Open controversy

Djokovic was set to start his 2022 season at the ATP Cup in Sydney but withdrew.[237] To compete in the Australian Open, players were required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or have a medical exemption. Djokovic received an exemption from Tennis Australia and the Department of Health (Victoria), citing a positive COVID-19 test on 16 December 2021.[238] He was granted a visa on 18 November 2021 and arrived in Melbourne on 5 January, but was detained by the Australian Border Force for failing to meet entry requirements for unvaccinated travellers.[239] Djokovic later admitted an error in his travel declaration form, as he had been in Spain shortly before arriving.[240] His visa was cancelled, and he was held in a detention hotel pending appeal.[241] On 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia ruled in Djokovic's favour, ordering his release and noting that he was denied enough time to consult with lawyers and tennis officials before his interview.[242] However, on 14 January, Alex Hawke, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, cancelled Djokovic's visa again under the Migration Act 1958, citing public health and order concerns.[243] The Federal Court of Australia upheld the decision, and Djokovic was deported on 16 January.[244]

After Australia
In February, Djokovic returned at the Dubai Championships, where vaccination was not required.[245] He lost in the quarterfinals to Jiří Veselý, resulting in the loss of his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. It was the first time since 2004 that a player outside the Big Four held the top spot.[246] Djokovic withdrew from the Indian Wells Masters and Miami Open due to U.S. entry restrictions on unvaccinated foreigners.[247] Despite not playing, he regained No. 1 when Medvedev lost early at Indian Wells.[248] He began his clay season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing his opening match to Davidovich Fokina.[249] At the Serbia Open, he reached the final but lost to Andrey Rublev.[250] In May, he was beaten by Carlos Alcaraz in the Madrid Open semifinals.[251] A week later, he won the Italian Open, his sixth title there and a record-extending 38th Masters crown, after defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final. In the semis, he claimed his 1,000th career win by beating Casper Ruud.[252][253] At the French Open, he advanced to the quarterfinals without dropping a set, but lost to Rafael Nadal in their record 59th match, ending his title defense and again dropping to No. 2.[254] At Wimbledon, he earned his 80th win at each major with a first-round victory over Kwon Soon-woo, becoming the first player to do so.[255] He reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final after defeating Cameron Norrie in the semifinals[256] and beat Nick Kyrgios in four sets to claim his seventh Wimbledon and 21st major title, surpassing Roger Federer and moving one behind Nadal.[257][258] Due to U.S. travel restrictions for unvaccinated foreigners, Djokovic was unable to enter the country and withdrew from the US Open.[259]

2023: Record-breaking 24th major & 7th ATP Finals titles
Main article: 2023 Novak Djokovic tennis season

Djokovic at the 2023 French Open
Djokovic opened the year with his 92nd title at the Adelaide International, saving a championship point to beat Sebastian Korda. At the Australian Open, despite a hamstring issue,[260] he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to claim a record-extending 10th title and reclaim the No. 1 ranking.[261] He missed the Indian Wells and 2023 Miami Open due to U.S. entry restrictions. During the clay season, he exited early at the Monte-Carlo Masters and Banja Luka Open, and lost in the Rome quarterfinals. At the French Open, Djokovic defeated world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz in the semis and beat Casper Ruud in the final to win a record-breaking 23rd major, becoming the first man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam.[15] He also regained the top ranking.[262]

At Wimbledon, Djokovic reached his 9th final but lost to Alcaraz in five sets, ending a 34-match winning streak at Wimbledon.[263] Djokovic then won the Cincinnati Open, beating Alcaraz in 3 hours and 49 minutes in the longest best-of-three-set ATP final, hailed as one of the greatest matches ever.[264] At the US Open, he triumphed over Medvedev in straight sets to win his fourth US Open title and a record-extending 24th men's singles major title overall.[265][266] Djokovic became the oldest US Open men's singles champion in the Open Era.[267][268]

2024: Olympic gold, Career Super Slam, oldest ATP No. 1
Main article: 2024 Novak Djokovic tennis season

At the Australian Open, Djokovic reached the semifinals but lost to world No. 4 Jannik Sinner in four sets, ending his 33-match win streak at the event and marking his first semifinal defeat there. He called it "one of the worst Grand Slam matches I've ever played".[269] Nonetheless, he equaled Roger Federer's record of 58 Grand Slam singles quarterfinals[270] and retained his world No. 1 ranking. Djokovic returned to the Indian Wells Masters for the first time since 2019, but lost in the third round to Luca Nardi, ranked No. 123—the lowest-ranked player to beat him at a Masters 1000 or Grand Slam.[271] At the 2024 Monte-Carlo Masters, he reached the semifinals but lost to Casper Ruud. In Rome, after being accidentally struck by a water bottle post-match,[272] he lost in the third round to Alejandro Tabilo. At the 2024 Geneva Open, he earned his 1,100th career win on his 37th birthday, becoming the third man in the Open Era to reach that mark, and holding the highest win percentage among them (83.5%).[273] At the French Open, Djokovic survived a five-set match against Lorenzo Musetti that ended at 3:07 a.m.—the latest finish in tournament history.[274] In the fourth round, he defeated Francisco Cerúndolo in his longest French Open match (4h39m), surpassing Federer's records for most Grand Slam match wins and quarterfinal appearances.[275] However, he suffered a torn medial meniscus in his right knee during that match and withdrew before the quarterfinals, losing the No. 1 ranking to Sinner.[276] At the Wimbledon Championships, Djokovic reached his 37th Grand Slam final, aiming to equal Federer's record of eight titles, but lost in straight sets to Carlos Alcaraz in a repeat of the 2023 final.[277][278] At the 2024 Summer Olympics, Djokovic defeated Matthew Ebden, Rafael Nadal, Dominik Koepfer, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Lorenzo Musetti to reach his first Olympic final.[279] He then beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to win the gold medal, completing a Career Golden Slam and Career Super Slam.[280]

2025: 100th ATP title and further records broken
Main article: 2025 Novak Djokovic tennis season
Djokovic opened the 2025 season at the Brisbane International, losing to Reilly Opelka in the quarterfinals.[281] His second round match at the Australian Open marked his 430th career major main draw singles match, surpassing Roger Federer's all-time record.[282] After defeating Jiri Lehecka in the fourth round, he prevailed over Carlos Alcaraz once again in four sets.[283] However, Djokovic's run ended when he retired in his semifinal match against Alexander Zverev due to a muscle tear after only one set played.[284]

Djokovic then participated in the newly upgraded ATP 500 Tournament in Doha, but lost to Matteo Berrettini in the first round. This marked the first time Djokovic lost in any first round since the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Djokovic's next tournament was the Indian Wells Open, where he suffered a 2nd round defeat to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp – the 2nd year in a row where he lost to a lucky loser at the same tournament, following Luca Nardi.

At the 2025 Miami Open, Djokovic reached the third round defeating Rinky Hijikata and equalled Rafael Nadal’s record number of Masters 1000-level wins at 410.[285] With his win over lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli in the third round, Djokovic claimed his 411th career main draw win at Masters 1000 level, surpassing Nadal's record.[286] He lost in the final to Jakub Menšík.

In May 2025, it was announced that Andy Murray would no longer be working as Djokovic's coach, by mutual agreement reached after Djokovic started working with Murray in November 2024.[287] Djokovic took a last minute entry to the 2025 Geneva Open, where he defeated Hubert Hurkacz in the final to claim the 100th ATP singles title of his career, becoming the first ever tennis player to win at least one ATP singles title in twenty consecutive seasons, and the 3rd tennis player in the Open Era to have won 100 or more career titles (after Jimmy Connors and Federer).[288] At the French Open, Djokovic reached a record-extending 51st major semifinal, where he lost in straight sets to world No. 1 Jannik Sinner.[289][290] By winning the quarterfinals, he recorded his 101st wins at the tournament, the second most after Rafael Nadal. At Wimbledon, Djokovic was again defeated by Sinner in the semifinal (his record-extending 52nd semifinal), with Djokovic noting that the "age, the wear and tear of the body" meant he was limited in his ability to beat players like Sinner or Alcaraz. It was the first time he failed to make the Wimbledon final since 2017.[291]

Rivalries
Prominent rivalries
See also: Big Three (tennis) and List of tennis rivalries
Djokovic has a winning record against all of his top contemporaries, including his fellow Big Three counterparts, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

Rafael Nadal
Main article: Djokovic–Nadal rivalry
Djokovic and Rafael Nadal's rivalry is the most prolific in men's tennis in the Open Era. The two faced each other 60 times, with Djokovic leading 31–29.[292][293] Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–7 while Nadal leads on clay 20–9, and they are tied on grass 2–2.[294]

Djokovic is the only player to defeat Nadal in all four majors. He is also the player with the most victories over Nadal on clay, beating him twice at the French Open and all three clay court Masters events, notably at the 2013 Monte-Carlo Masters where he ended Nadal's run of eight consecutive titles. The two contested the longest major final ever played at the 2012 Australian Open, where Djokovic won in five sets after 5 hours and 53 minutes.[295][296][297] Other classics they played include the 2009 Madrid Masters semifinal,[298] 2011 Miami Masters final,[299][300] the 2013 French Open semifinal,[301] 2018 Wimbledon semifinal,[302][303] and the 2021 French Open semifinal.[304]

Roger Federer
Main article: Djokovic–Federer rivalry

Djokovic and Federer after their semifinal match at the 2011 US Open
Djokovic and Roger Federer's rivalry is considered to be one of the greatest rivalries in tennis history. They faced each other 50 times, with Djokovic leading 27–23, including 13–6 in finals (not including a 2014 walkover in favor of Djokovic). Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–18 and on grass 3–1, and they are split 4–4 on clay.[305]

Djokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments: four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times in the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their last final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in the longest final in Wimbledon history.[306][307] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[308][309][310]

Andy Murray
Main article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry
Djokovic and Andy Murray met 36 times, with Djokovic leading 25–11.[311] Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–8 and 5–1 on clay, while Murray won their two matches on grass. Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (the other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic, so they progressed through the ranks of the junior circuit together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers at Les Petits As in 2001.[49] They were the 2015 and 2016 year-end top two players in the world, with the battle for the 2016 year-end No. 1 only being decided in the final of the World Tour Finals, which was won by Murray in straight sets.[312]

One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Djokovic saved five championship points to win his first Shanghai Masters title and end Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event.[313] Tennis pundits have classified many more of their matches as instant classics, such as the 2011 Italian Open semifinals, the 2012 Australian Open semifinal, 2012 US Open final, the 2015 semifinal and 2016 final at the French Open, and the 2017 Qatar Open final.[314][315]

Stan Wawrinka
Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. Although this rivalry is lopsided in favor of Djokovic, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[316] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[317][318][319][320][321][322][323] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth.[324] Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[325] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[326]

At the 2015 French Open final, Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in four sets to claim his second major title. Later that year, Djokovic beat Wawrinka at the Cincinnati Masters and Paris Masters.[327] At the 2016 US Open, Wawrinka beat Djokovic in a major final for a second time.[328]

Despite Djokovic's 21–6 overall record against Wawrinka, Wawrinka leads Djokovic 3–2 in ATP finals, two of which in major finals.[329] During Djokovic's run of 13 major finals from the 2014 Wimbledon Championships through the 2020 Australian Open, his only two losses were to Wawrinka. Contrary to most high-profile rivalries, the pair have also played doubles together.[330]

Jo-Wilfried Tsonga
Djokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga met 23 times, with Djokovic leading 17–6.[331] Their first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Australian Open, which Djokovic won in four sets to win his first major singles title.[331] Tsonga got revenge in their next meeting at the majors, the 2010 Australian Open quarterfinals, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match.[332] Djokovic then won their next match at the 2011 Wimbledon semifinals to advance to his first final there, claiming the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in the process.[333] They met again in the quarterfinals of the 2012 French Open, which Djokovic won in five sets after over four hours.[334] They then played a further three matches in 2012, in the quarterfinals of the Olympics, the final of the China Open, and in the round robin stage of the ATP Finals, with Djokovic winning all of them in straight sets.[331] Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open, which Djokovic won in straight sets.[331]

Juan Martín del Potro
Djokovic and Juan Martín del Potro met 20 times, with Djokovic leading 16–4.[335] Djokovic won their first four meetings, before back-to-back victories for del Potro at the 2011 Davis Cup and their Bronze medal match at the 2012 Summer Olympics in straight sets. Djokovic won the next four matches before he lost to del Potro at the 2013 Indian Wells Masters, where the Argentine made his second career Masters final. Djokovic got the upper hand on the rivalry once again by winning two of the most important matches between them to date; an epic five-setter at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships semifinals (which was the longest Wimbledon semifinal at the time),[336] and a thrilling three-setter at the 2013 Shanghai Masters final. Del Potro upset Djokovic in the first round at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio en route to the final. In 2018, Djokovic defeated del Potro in three close sets in the final of the US Open, which was the first Grand Slam final for del Potro since his 2009 US Open victory. They played their last match at the 2019 Italian Open quarterfinal which Djokovic won in a dramatic three-setter after saving two match points.

Player profile
Playing style
Djokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[337] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[338][339][340] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[341] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[337] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career "Under Pressure Rating" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.[342]

Djokovic has been described as one of the fittest and most complete athletes in sports history, with high agility, court coverage and mobility, which allows him to hit winners from seemingly indefensible positions.[343][344] Because of this, coupled with flexibility and length, he rarely gets aced. Todd Martin, who coached Djokovic between 2009 and 2010, noted that:[345]

His athleticism is from another world. His return of serve is way better than any other return of serve ever and I mean way better. Nobody has gotten so many balls back and neutralized so many good serves.

Djokovic's return of serve is a big weapon for him, with which he can be both offensive and defensive. He is highly efficient off both the forehand and backhand return, often getting the return in play deep with pace, neutralizing the advantage the server usually has in a point. Andre Agassi described Djokovic's return of serve as "the precedent-setting standard for the return".[346][347] Occasionally, Djokovic employs a well-disguised backhand underspin drop shot and sliced backhand.

Djokovic commented on the modern style of play, including his own, in an interview with Jim Courier after his semifinal win against Andy Murray in the 2012 Australian Open tournament:[348]

I had a big privilege and honour to meet personally today Mr. Laver, and he is one of the biggest, and greatest players ever to play the game, thank you for staying this late, sir, thank you ... even though it would actually be better if we played a couple times serve and volley, but we don't know to play ... we are mostly around here [points to the area near the baseline], we are running, you know, around the baseline ...

In assessing Djokovic's 2011 season, Jimmy Connors said that Djokovic gives his opponents problems by playing "a little bit old-school, taking the ball earlier, catching the ball on the rise, (and) driving the ball flat". Connors adds that a lot of the topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him comes right into his zone, thus his ability to turn defense into offense well.[349]

Equipment
Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic used the Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed sponsors to Wilson in 2005. He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[350] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[351] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[352] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[353]

Coaching and personal team
See also: Novak Djokovic coaches
Djokovic has worked with numerous coaches, trainers, and advisors throughout his career. His earliest mentors were Jelena Genčić and Nikola Pilić, whom he credits as foundational influences in his development. Genčić coached him in Belgrade from 1993 to 1999, while Pilić worked with him in Munich from 1999 to 2003.[31][26][28] In 2004 and 2005, he was coached by Dejan Petrović, during which time he rose from outside the top 300 to inside the top 100.[354] From late 2005 to mid-2006, he briefly worked with Riccardo Piatti, before parting ways due to scheduling conflicts.[83][355] From 2006 to 2017, Djokovic's main coach was Marián Vajda, who became a long-time collaborator. During this period, he also worked occasionally with specialists such as Mark Woodforde (2007) and Todd Martin (2009–2010).[356] Djokovic's physical team included physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, fitness coach Ronen Bega (until 2009), and Austrian trainer Gebhard Phil-Gritsch from 2009 onward.[83][357][358] In 2008, he began working with Italian agent Edoardo Artaldi, who, alongside his wife Elena Capellaro, managed Djokovic's affairs and logistics.[359] Their professional relationship lasted until 2023, despite occasional tensions, such as during the final of the 2023 Adelaide International 1 – Men's singles.[360] Nutritionist Igor Četojević joined the team in 2010 and helped reform Djokovic's diet, contributing to his physical transformation.[357][361]

Off the court
Philanthropy

Kindergarten in Jalovik village built by the Novak Djokovic Foundation[362]
In 2007, Djokovic founded the Novak Djokovic Foundation.[363] The organization's mission is to help children from disadvantaged communities grow up and develop in stimulating and safe environments.[364] The foundation partnered with the World Bank in August 2015 to promote early childhood education in Serbia.[365][366][367] His foundation has built 50 schools as of April 2022 and are building their 51st, and supported more than 20,800 children and over a thousand families.[368][369]

Djokovic participated in charity matches to raise funds for the reconstruction of the Avala Tower, as well as to aid victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010–11 Queensland floods.[370][371][372] Starting in 2007, he has established a tradition of hosting and socializing with hundreds of Kosovo Serb children during Davis Cup matches organized in Serbia.[373] Djokovic was selected as the 2012 Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year, for his contributions through the foundation, his role as a UNICEF national ambassador and other charitable projects.[374] In August 2015, he was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[20]

During the 2014 Balkans floods, Djokovic sparked worldwide financial and media support for victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.[375] After winning the 2014 Rome Masters, Djokovic donated his prize money to the flood victims in Serbia, while his foundation collected another $600,000.[375][369] Following his 2016 Australian Open victory, Djokovic donated $20,000 to Melbourne City Mission's early childhood education program to help disadvantaged children.[376] After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, he and his wife announced that they will donate €1 million for the purchase of ventilators and medical equipment to support hospitals and other medical institutions.[377] He also made a donation to Bergamo, Italy‚ one of the worst-affected Italian provinces, as well as to Novi Pazar, Serbia and North Mitrovica, Kosovo.[378][379][380]

Sponsorships and business ventures
Djokovic endorses Serbian telecommunications company Telekom Srbija and German nutritional supplement brand FitLine.[381]

On turning professional in 2003, Djokovic began wearing Adidas clothing. At the end of 2009, Djokovic signed a 10-year deal with the Italian clothing company Sergio Tacchini after Adidas refused to extend his clothing contract (choosing instead to sign Andy Murray).[382] Tacchini doesn't make shoes so Djokovic continued with Adidas as his choice of footwear. His sponsorship contract with Tacchini was incentive-heavy, and Djokovic's disproportionate success and dominance in 2011 caused the company to fall behind on bonus payments, leading to the termination of the sponsorship contract.[383][384]

From 2011, Djokovic began to wear custom Red and Blue Adidas Barricade 6.0's shoes, referring to the colors of the Serbian national flag. By April 2012, the Tacchini deal had fallen first short and then apart. At that point, he was set to join forces with Nike, Inc.,[385] but instead, on 23 May 2012, Uniqlo appointed Djokovic as its global brand ambassador. The five-year sponsorship, reportedly worth €8 million per year,[386] began on 27 May 2012 in Paris' French Open tennis tournament. A year later, Djokovic's long-term footwear deal with Adidas was announced ahead of 2013 French Open.[387] Since January 2018 Novak has been wearing Asics shoes.[388][389]

In August 2011, Djokovic became the brand ambassador of Swiss watch manufacturer Audemars Piguet.[390] Less than a month later, Djokovic signed a sponsorship deal with German car company Mercedes-Benz.[391] In March 2012, Djokovic was announced by Bombardier Aerospace as its latest Learjet brand ambassador, thus joining the likes of actor and pilot John Travolta, architect Frank Gehry, maestro Valery Gergiev, and classical pianist Lang Lang.[392] From January 2014 Djokovic has been endorsing French car manufacturer Peugeot.[393] At the same time he entered into an endorsement deal with Japanese watch manufacturer Seiko,[394] having just ended his affiliation with their rivals Audemars Piguet.[395] In early 2015, ahead of the Australian Open, Djokovic teamed up with Australian banking corporation ANZ for a social media campaign to raise money for local communities across the Asia Pacific region.[396][397] At the same time his partnership with Jacob's Creek, an Australian wine brand owned by Orlando Wines, was announced in regards to the production and distribution of 'Made By' film series, a documentary style content meant to "show a side of Novak not seen before as he recounts never before told life stories from Belgrade, Serbia, celebrating what has made him the champion he is today".[398]

Since 2004, the business end of Djokovic's career has been handled by Israeli managers Amit Naor (former pro tennis player turned sports agent) and Allon Khakshouri,[399] a duo which also had Marat Safin and Dinara Safina as its clients. In June 2008, after the duo entered into a partnership with CAA Sports, the sports division of Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency, meaning that the famous company started representing tennis players for the first time,[400] Djokovic formally signed with CAA Sports.[401] After Djokovic's contract with CAA Sports expired during summer 2012, he decided to switch representation, announcing IMG Worldwide as his new representatives in December 2012.[402]

On 22 May 2017, Djokovic was unveiled as a brand ambassador of Lacoste after a five-year partnership with Uniqlo.[403]

During the 2021 US Open, some people in Djokovic's player box wore hats and shirts bearing the logo of Raiffeisen Bank International, the central back of one of the two largest banking cooperatives in Austria. In April 2021, Djokovic became a brand ambassador for RBI and its subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe. The bank will help to support Djokovic's tennis academy in Belgrade.[404] Djokovic did not wear the RBI logo, but he did wear on his shirt the logo of UKG, an American workforce management and human resource management company. People in his box wore the logo on hats as well. UKG lists Djokovic as one of their sponsored athletes.[405]

Investments
In 2005, as Djokovic moved up the tennis rankings, he began venturing into the business world. Most of his activities in the business arena have been channeled through Family Sport, a legal entity in Serbia established and run by members of his immediate family. Registered as a limited liability company, Family Sport initially focused on hospitality, specifically the restaurant business, by launching Novak Café & Restaurant, a franchise developed on the theme of Djokovic's tennis success. Over time, the company, whose day-to-day operations are mostly handled by Novak's father Srdjan and uncle Goran, expanded its activities into real estate, sports/entertainment event organization, and sports apparel distribution.[406]

The company launched Novak Café & Restaurant in 2008 in the Belgrade municipality of Novi Beograd, the flagship location in a franchised chain of theme café-restaurants. During 2009, two more locations were added—one in Kragujevac and the other in Belgrade, the city's second, in September at the neighbourhood of Dorćol overlooking the playing courts of Serbia Open whose inaugural edition took place several months earlier.[407] On 16 December 2011 a location in Novi Sad was opened,[408] however, it operated just over three years before closing in late March 2015.[409] Banja Luka in neighbouring Bosnia got its Novak Café & Restaurant location on 16 October 2015 within Hotel Trešnja on Banj hill.[410][411]

In 2009, the company bought a 250-series ATP tournament known as the Dutch Open and moved it to Serbia where it was renamed the Serbia Open. With the help of Belgrade city authorities, the tournament's inaugural edition was held in May 2009 at the city-owned "Milan Gale Muškatirović" courts, located at an attractive spot in Dorćol neighbourhood.[412] The tournament folded in 2012 after four editions and its place in the ATP calendar got taken over by the Düsseldorf Open.

In May 2015, right after winning his fourth Rome Masters title, Djokovic launched a line of nutritional food products, called Djokolife.[413] On 10 April 2016, while in town for the Monte-Carlo Masters, Djokovic opened a vegan restaurant called Eqvita in Monte Carlo.[414] The restaurant reportedly closed in March 2019.[415]

Djokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[416] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it "does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works", while Peter Collignon commented that their website "describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success".[417]

In August 2025, Djokovic became a co-owner of French Ligue 2 club Le Mans FC through the Brazilian consortium OutField, alongside Formula One drivers Felipe Massa and Kevin Magnussen, and Georgios Frangulis, CEO of OakBerry.[418][419]

Professional Tennis Players Association
In August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organization to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[420]

In popular culture
Throughout the latter part of the 2007 season, including before Wimbledon and during US Open, his comedic impressions of fellow contemporary tennis players received much media play.[421] It began when a BBC camera crew recorded some footage of the twenty-year-old impersonating Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Goran Ivanišević, and Lleyton Hewitt on a practice court at London's Queen's Club Championships just before Wimbledon.[422] The material — consisting of Djokovic imitating the said players by exaggerating their trademark physical gestures or nervous tics for the entertainment of his coaching team Marián Vajda and Mark Woodforde — aired during BBC's coverage of the tournament and subsequently became popular online.[423] Two months later at the US Open, a phone video shot by Argentine players of Djokovic doing locker room impressions of players such as Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Filippo Volandri and Nadal made its way online, becoming viral.[422][424] A few days later, after beating Carlos Moyá in the quarterfinals, USA Network's on-court interviewer Michael Barkann asked Djokovic to perform some impressions and the player obliged by doing Sharapova and Nadal to the delight of the crowd.[422][425][426][427]

In addition to Djokovic, the national surge in the popularity of tennis was also inspired by three other up-and-coming young players: twenty-year-old Ana Ivanovic, twenty-two-year-old Jelena Janković, and twenty-three-year-old Janko Tipsarević as evidenced in early December 2007 when a sports-entertainment show named NAJJ Srbije (The Best of Serbia), put together in honour of the four players' respective successes in the 2007 season, drew a capacity crowd to Belgrade's Kombank Arena.[428][429] In May 2008, he was a special guest during the first semifinal of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Belgrade that year. He threw a big tennis ball into the crowd, announcing the start of the voting and together with one of the show's co-presenters, Željko Joksimović, Djokovic sang Đorđe Marjanović's song "Beograde".[430]

Throughout late April and early May 2009, during ATP Master Series tournaments in Rome and Madrid, respectively, the Serb was a guest on the Fiorello Show on Sky Uno hosted by Italian comedian Rosario Fiorello[431] followed by an appearance on Pablo Motos' show El Hormiguero.[432]

Djokovic is also featured in the music video for the song "Hello" by Martin Solveig and Dragonette. The video, filmed at Stade Roland Garros, shows Solveig facing off against Bob Sinclar, another DJ, in a tennis match. When the referee calls a crucial ball "Out", Djokovic enters the arena and convinces the referee otherwise.[433] In 2010, the Serbian blues-rock band Zona B recorded the song "The Joker", dedicating it to Djokovic.[434][435]


Djokovic with Emir Kusturica in Andrićgrad in January 2014, where he received Key to the City
On 25 June 2011, at the Serbian National Defense Council's seventieth congress in Chicago, Djokovic was unanimously awarded the Order of Serbian National Defense in America I class – the highest decoration of the SND. The order was given to the twenty-four-year-old for his merits on the international sports scene and his contributions to the reputation of Serbs and Serbia around the world.[436] The day after winning his first Wimbledon title and reaching the No. 1 ranking for the first time in his career, Djokovic went home to Belgrade for a homecoming celebration in front of the Serbian National Assembly, an event attended by close to 100,000 people.[437]

On 28 November 2011, after returning from London where he finished early due to failing to progress out of his round-robin group, Djokovic visited his childhood tennis coach Jelena Genčić at her Belgrade home, bringing the Wimbledon trophy along.[438] The meeting, reportedly their first in more than four years, was recorded by two television crews – a Serbian one shooting for Aleksandar Gajšek's show Agape on Studio B television[439][440] and an American one from CBS television network filming material for Djokovic's upcoming piece on 60 Minutes. The next day, 29 November 2011, on invitation from film producer Avi Lerner, Djokovic was part of the high-budget Hollywood movie production The Expendables 2 in a cameo playing himself[441] that was shot in a warehouse in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.[442] However, his bit part was later cut out of the final version of the movie.[443]

In March 2012, he was profiled on the CBS show 60 Minutes by their correspondent Bob Simon. He was named amongst the 100 most influential people of 2012 by TIME magazine.[444]

Djokovic has been a guest on late-night talk shows, such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Veče sa Ivanom Ivanovićem, Conan, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Late Show with David Letterman, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, The Jonathan Ross Show and The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[445]

In April 2021, a team of Balkan biospeleologists named a recently discovered freshwater snail species Travunijana djokovici after Djokovic.[446]

In 2022, a book titled Facing Novak Djokovic, a compilation of interviews with ATP players who described in detail what it's like to compete against Djokovic, was published.[447]

In 2022, Nikola Vesović, a research associate at the University of Belgrade, announced that a new species of beetle in the genus Duvalius recently discovered near the town of Ljubovija, Serbia, had been named Duvalius djokovici after Djokovic.[448]

Djokovic appears in the 2024 documentary Federer: Twelve Final Days about Roger Federer's final tournament before his retirement, the 2022 Laver Cup. In July 2024, Djokovic became the first man and the first athlete on the cover of Vogue Adria.[449] He appeared on the front cover of the 2024 video game Tiebreak: Official game of the ATP and WTA, alongside Coco Gauff. One of the game's features is a ""Novak Djokovic Slam Challenge".[450][451]

Views on diet, medicine and science
Since 2010, he has been connected with the nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and performs acupuncture.[357] He allegedly discovered that Djokovic suffers from gluten intolerance, using applied kinesiology, and that he should not eat gluten, removing it from his diet.[361] He eventually settled on a vegan diet, while later sometimes eating fish.[452] He also claims this vegan, plant-based diet cured his persistent allergies and mild asthma.[453] The gluten-free diet has been credited for improving his endurance on the court and playing a role in his subsequent success.[454][455]

Following his elbow surgery in 2018, he stated that he "cried for three days" after it, feeling guilty, because he was "not a fan of surgeries or medications" and wanted "to be as natural as possible". He further stated his belief that human "bodies are self-healing mechanisms".[456][457]

In his 2013 autobiography, Serve to Win, he wrote of a "researcher" who directed "anger, fear, hostility" at a glass of water, which turned "slightly green" after a few days, while also directing "love, joy" at another glass of water, which remained "bright and crystal clear" in the same period.[361][458] In 2020, Djokovic spoke of his belief that "some people" used "prayer" and "gratitude" to "turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water." He also stated that "scientists [have] proven" that "molecules in the water react to our emotions" and speech.[459][460] Such claims are scientifically dubious,[461][462] and generally regarded as superstitious beliefs.[463]

Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandate
See also: 2022 Australian Open § Djokovic's vaccination and visa controversy
During the ATP Tour's shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in a Facebook live stream with other Serbian athletes hosted in April 2020, Djokovic indicated he opposes vaccination and would not be forced to take a COVID vaccine just to be able to return to the Тour.[457][464] He later clarified his remarks by stating that he is not against all kinds of vaccines, but that he is against forced vaccination.[465] He added that he was extremely careful about what he puts into his body.[465]

Djokovic's views came under increased scrutiny in late 2021, in the run-up to the 2022 Australian Open, after comments made by Australian government officials indicated that tennis players would need to be vaccinated to enter the tournament.[466] Prior to the tournament, Djokovic had refused to state publicly whether he was vaccinated or not, but had made comments stating his concern over the possibility of a hotel quarantine in Australia.[467] However, while being interviewed by the Australian Border Force in January 2022, Djokovic confirmed to the officer interviewing him that he was unvaccinated.[468][469]

"The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else."

—Djokovic, on why he is willing to forgo playing major tournaments.
Several commentators feel that Djokovic's stance against the COVID-19 vaccine could damage his placement among the all-time great tennis players as he would not be able to participate in the major tournaments where vaccination is required for entry[470][471][472][473][474][475] while others have applauded his view of having a choice.[476][477][478][479] He was unable to play the 2022 Australian Open, where he was the defending champion and the favorite to win.[12][473] Shortly thereafter, he lost the No. 1 ranking he had held for a record 373 weeks. Due to the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens, Djokovic was unable to enter the United States to play the 2022 US Open, another major tournament he was the favorite to win.[13]

In an interview with the BBC on 15 February 2022, a few weeks after the tournament, Djokovic stated he does not associate with the wider anti-vax movement. However, he believes in personal freedom of choice and supports an individual's right to choose whether or not they receive a vaccine. He re-affirmed sticking to his principles and refusal to receive a vaccine, saying that he would be willing to forgo entry into tournaments which are held in countries mandating the vaccine even if it cost him his career records and placement among the all-time great players.[11]

Faith and religious beliefs
Djokovic is a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He was baptized in May 1992 at the Žiča Monastery, alongside his mother and younger brother Marko.[480] On 28 April 2011, Patriarch Irinej of Serbia awarded Djokovic the Order of St. Sava I class, the highest decoration of the Serbian Orthodox Church, for his contributions to monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo and charitable work in Serbia.[481] He has said that he admired and held in high regard Bishop Amfilohije, who played a key part in helping him through a tough time during the Yugoslav Wars.[482]

Djokovic has been reported to meditate for up to an hour a day at the Buddhist Buddhapadipa Temple in Wimbledon as he appreciates the natural setting and serenity, and is close to monks in the complex.[483] He has spoken of the positive power of meditation.[484][485][486] He is a frequent visitor of the Bosnian town of Visoko and its park that is host to several meditation platforms.[487]

Support of sport and sportspeople
Djokovic is a fan of Serbian football club Red Star,[488] Italian club Milan,[489] and Portuguese club Benfica,[490] as well as Serbian basketball club Red Star.[491][492] He has also shown public support for Croatia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and when faced with criticism from some within his native country of Serbia, Djokovic replied that "sports have their 'universal language,' they erase boundaries between people, [and] overcome differences in religion, race and nationality."[493][494][495] Djokovic has expressed admiration for Croatian football player Luka Modrić, who plays for Real Madrid.[496][497][498] He is a friend of former Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic, whom he has known since the two were children growing up in Serbia.[499]

Djokovic is a member of the "Champions for Peace" club, a group of elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport. It was created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.[500]

Political statements
Following his victory in the first round of the 2023 French Open, Djokovic wrote "Kosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence" on the lens of a camera, in response to the recent clashes in Kosovo. The statement was criticized as inappropriate by France's then-minister of sports Amélie Oudéa-Castéra, with the Kosovo Olympic Committee asking the IOC to open disciplinary proceedings against the athlete.[501] Djokovic later said he was against any kind of conflict but defended his statement by opining: "Especially as a son of a man born in Kosovo, I feel the need to give my support to our people and to the entirety of Serbia. Kosovo is our cradle, our stronghold, centre of the most important things for our country. There are many reasons why I wrote that on the camera."[502]

Legacy
"I believe that numbers are numbers and statistics are statistics and, in that sense, I think he [Djokovic] has better numbers than mine and that is indisputable. It is not beneath me nor do I have an ego big enough to try and disguise a reality that is not. This is the truth. The rest are tastes, inspiration, sensations that one player or the other may transmit to you, that you may like one or the other more. I think that with respect to titles, Djokovic is the best in history and there is nothing to discuss in that."

— Rafael Nadal on Djokovic's legacy.[503][504][505]
Djokovic is regarded by many observers, tennis players and coaches as the greatest tennis player of all time, primarily for his achievements across all top-level tournaments of the men's professional tour in addition to his time spent with the world No. 1 ranking. Some media outlets, including Reuters, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Marca, Forbes, Tennis World USA, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Sporting News have named Djokovic the greatest male tennis player in history.[506][507][508][509][510][511][512]

Djokovic has won a record 72 Big Titles, including an all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles, and holds the most weeks at No. 1, the most wins over top 5 and top 10-ranked players, has won all major and Masters events and the year-end championships at least twice (which has not been done by another player once) and has a winning head-to-head record over his greatest rivals in one of the strongest eras of tennis.[513][514][515][516][517][518][519] Former world No. 1 Daniil Medvedev labelled Djokovic the "greatest tennis player in history" after winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open over Djokovic.[520] Pat Cash emphasized that Djokovic is one of two players who beat Rafael Nadal at the French Open, which he considers to be "the biggest challenge in tennis".[521] Richard Krajicek and The Roar, sports opinion website, said that Djokovic should be considered for the greatest player of all time because he is the only one among his rivals who has won all four majors consecutively.[522][523][524] Patrick Mouratoglou stated, "Novak is the most complete player of all times. That enables him to find the solution to most of the problems on court and this, on every surface. It explains why he is now in the best position to become the GOAT".[525][526] Rafael Nadal has praised Djokovic's peak level of performance, stating in 2011 (when he went 0–6 against Djokovic for the season) that "[Djokovic's level is] probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw."[527] Nadal reiterated this after a one-sided loss in the 2016 Qatar Open final, stating that "I played against a player who did everything perfectly. I don't know anybody who's ever played tennis like this. Since I know this sport I've never seen somebody playing at this level."[528] In 2017, Nadal stated that "at a technical level, when Djokovic has been at the top of his game, I have to say that I've been up against an invincible player."[529][530] In 2023, former world No. 7 Mardy Fish also declared that Djokovic in 2011 was the "best player of all time".[531] In 2023, Boris Becker compared Djokovic to Lionel Messi, Tom Brady and LeBron James in their respective sports, saying that "For me, he is the lion king".[532]

Tennis coach Nick Bollettieri praised Djokovic as the "most complete player ever",[533] and the "most perfect player of all time":[534]

When you look at match players in the history of tennis, I don't believe that anybody can equal everything on the court that Djokovic does. I don't think you can find a weakness in his game. His movement, personality, his return of serve, his serve, excellent touch, not hesitant in coming to the net, great serve. Overall, almost every player has a downfall; to me, he doesn't have one. He's perhaps the best put-together player that I've seen over 60 years.[535]

Andre Agassi, stated in an interview in 2019 with the Times of India that:

The highest standard of tennis that I've ever seen is when Novak is playing his best tennis. The single level, for whatever my tennis IQ is worth, is an unmistakable standard to which everybody will strive to be.[536]

Pete Sampras, who at the time of his retirement in 2003 was considered by some to be the greatest male tennis player of all time, stated after Djokovic earned a record-breaking seventh year-end No. 1 finish in 2021:

Seven years for him, I'm sure he sees it as a bonus to all the majors that he's won, but I think he'll appreciate it more as he gets older. He did it at a time where he dominated two of the greats, in Roger and Rafa, and he handled the next generation of players very well – all at the same time. I do think what Novak's done over the past 10 years, winning the majors, being consistent, finishing number one for seven years, to me it's a clear sign that he is the greatest of all time.[516][537]

Some press reports have also called Djokovic one of the greatest athletes of all time.[538][539]

Tennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, such as the 2012 Australian Open final, in which he beat Nadal in five long and gruelling sets.[540][541] Other matches include the five-set 2013 Australian Open fourth round against Stan Wawrinka,[320][322] the 2018 Wimbledon semifinal against Nadal, which lasted five brutal sets played over two days,[542][543] the five-set 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, the longest Wimbledon final in history,[544][545] and the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final against Carlos Alcaraz, the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history.[546]

Nadal has also called Djokovic the greatest tennis player of all time in 2024.[547] Some analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history because of the quality of matches they produce.[548][549]
